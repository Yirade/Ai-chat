# :rocket: Chat AI

This is a simple chatbot based on JavaScript that allows the user to have a conversation with a virtual assistant. The assistant is able to generate automated responses using the OpenAI API.

## :gear: Getting Started

To get started, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI.

- Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Yirade/Ai-chat
```
- Replace YOUR_API_KEY in chat-cron.js with your OpenAI API key
```
 xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer your_api_key_here");
```


## :computer: Tech Stack

This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the layout and [Three Dots](https://github.com/nzbin/three-dots) for the loading animation.


## :speech_bubble: Using the Chatbot

To send a message to the chatbot, simply type it into the input field and press enter or click the send button. The chatbot will generate a response and display it in the chat window.

## :wrench: Customizing the Chatbot

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the generateBotMessage function in chat-cron.js. This function is responsible for generating the chatbot's responses. You can use the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the user's input, or you can simply hardcode a response.
